# Razorpay Integration Setup

## ✅ Already Configured!

Your project already has Razorpay configured with the key: `rzp_test_R9IWhVRyO9Ga0k`

The waiter payment system is now integrated with your existing Razorpay setup.

## Configuration Details

- **Current Key:** `rzp_test_R9IWhVRyO9Ga0k` (from your existing cart_screen.dart)
- **Merchant Name:** ByteEat
- **Configuration File:** `lib/config/razorpay_config.dart`

## Platform Setup

Since you already have Razorpay working in your cart screen, the platform configurations should already be in place. If you encounter any issues, check:

- **Android:** `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` should have Razorpay activity
- **iOS:** `ios/Runner/Info.plist` should have Razorpay URL schemes

## How It Works

1. **Order Ready:** Kitchen marks order as "Ready"
2. **Payment Dialog:** Waiter clicks "Pay & Complete" → Payment dialog appears
3. **Razorpay Integration:** Customer pays via Razorpay gateway
4. **Order Completion:** On successful payment:
   - Order status → "Completed"
   - Table session closed (table freed)
   - Success message shown

## Testing

- Use Razorpay test cards for testing
- Test card: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- Any future expiry date and any CVV

## Production Notes

- Replace test key with live key
- Implement proper order verification
- Add payment verification on backend
- Consider adding payment receipts
